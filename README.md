- 💞️ Baby Food Diet Tips -
- Here are practical tips for preparing your baby's food:

- Use Fresh Ingredients: Always prepare food with fresh, seasonal ingredients to maximize nutrition.
- Keep It Simple: Avoid spices, salt, and sugar; use natural flavors like cumin or cinnamon if needed.
- Batch Cooking: Prepare small batches and store portions in clean, airtight containers in the fridge/freezer for convenience.
- Hygiene First: Wash hands, utensils, and cooking surfaces thoroughly to ensure cleanliness.
- Cook Soft Foods: Ensure food is steamed, boiled, or well-cooked to make it soft and easy to digest.
- Offer Finger Foods: Boiled carrots, sweet potatoes, or small pieces of bread encourage self-feeding.
- Balance Nutrition: Include grains, proteins, veggies, fruits, and healthy fats in every meal.
- Prepare meals just before serving when possible, and introduce one new food at a time to watch for allergies.
